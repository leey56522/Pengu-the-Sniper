<a href="https://ibb.co/4SkyRJF"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pKqDjn1/sniper-pengu.png" alt="sniper-pengu"></a>
- This is a simple game where the player helps Pengu catch as many fish as possible
- Pengu can move left and right using arrow keys and shoot water to hit the group of fish through space bar. Pengu cannot move up and down
- The group of fish is moving down as time passes by. Pengu loses 1 life when any of the fish reaches the bottom of the screen
- If Pengu shoots all the fish down, a new group of fish appears. This new group moves faster than the previous group

## Technical Walkthrough
- This is a game built with Pygame, which can be installed via pip module

## Challenges I encountered
1. The project was huge, so it was hard to organize the codes efficiently. Each aspect of the game, such as settings 
2. Learning to use Pygame

## Upcoming Changes
1. Save highest score and initialize when the game starts
2. Make fish shoot water back at Pengu to make the game harder!
