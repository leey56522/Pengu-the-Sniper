<a href="https://ibb.co/4SkyRJF"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pKqDjn1/sniper-pengu.png" alt="sniper-pengu"></a>
- This is a simple game where the player helps Pengu catch as many fish as possible
- Pengu can move left and right using arrow keys and shoot water to hit the group of fish through space bar. Pengu cannot move up and down
- The group of fish is moving down as time passes by. Pengu loses 1 life when any of the fish reaches the bottom of the screen
- If Pengu shoots all the fish down, a new group of fish appears. This new group moves faster than the previous group

## Technical Walkthrough
- This is a game built with Pygame, which can be installed via pip module

## Challenges I encountered
1. The project was huge, so it was hard to organize the codes efficiently. Taught me the importance of organizing the coding using classes for readability and reusability 
2. Learning to use Pygame library. This is the first time I used a library, so I learned a lot about reading documentation and making module calls 

## Upcoming Changes
1. Save highest score and initialize when the game starts
2. Make fish shoot water back at Pengu to make the game harder!
